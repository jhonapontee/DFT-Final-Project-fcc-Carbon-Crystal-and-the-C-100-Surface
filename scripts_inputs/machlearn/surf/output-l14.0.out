|     Your FFT grids (NGX,NGY,NGZ) are not sufficient for an accurate         |
|     calculation. Thus, the results might be wrong. Good settings for        |
|     NGX, NGY and NGZ are 2, 2 and 4, respectively.                          |
|     Mind: This setting results in a small but reasonable wrap-around        |
|     error. It is also necessary to adjust these values to the FFT           |
|     routines you use.                                                       |
